# Hello World
<hr>

#### Hi there. My name is Devansh Patil, and I am a 14 year old self-taught aspiring developer.
 
 
### Who am I

Okay, so if you are here, you might have some foggy idea about who I am, and what I do. But if not, fear not [get it?]. I am a programming student/nerd who loves Computer Science, Maths, and [sometimes] Philosophy.

### Languages I know:
1. Python [MODULES: Arcade, Pandas]
2. HTMl | CSS
3. JavaScript and TypeScript
4. C#
5. Rust (Still learning)
6. Lua
7. Swift (not UIkit or SwiftUI)
8. C (Still learning)

### Fun facts about me (that I want to share)
* I hate StackOverflow (seriously!)
* I read Philosophy
* I am an introvert
* I live somewhere good exam marks are valued higher than happpiness and life

### My favourite things
* **FAVOURITE IDE**: A few weeks ago, I would have said [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com), but I soon got tired of its slow speed, so I moved onto [GEANY](https://geany.org)
* **FAVOURITE BOOK**: *Ask the Dust* by *John Fante*
* **FAVOURITE BROWSER**: Brave

### Top sites

### My hobbies

* Learning programming languages
* Reading books
